Welcome to DeHackED64

DeHackED64 was created to bring the joys of modding Doom to the Doom64 community in the form of DOOM64EX+ and DeHacked64.

This directory serves as both an example of usage and of documentation.

Directories:

Things: This is the complete list of all 'things' in DOOM64 along with their ID and Name.
Weapons: This is the complete list of all 'weapons' in DOOM64 along with their ID and Name.
States: This is a list of all popular states and frames.  This is not an exhaustive list as many things
	such as torches or poles are static entities and do not affect gameplay much.  However
	these states will slowly be documented.  It takes quite some time to generate this information.

	The files in this States directory are also examples of 'fast attacks'.  So all monsters, all weapons have
	their frames increased in speed.  Again, as an example and documentation.
Misc:  This is the complete list of all Misc options available and examples of giving ammo and extra health, etc..

I hope you enjoy DeHackEd64!
