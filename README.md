# New game mode Complex DOOM 64 

What is the game mode Complex DOOM 64 ?

this is a game mode that will completely change the playing experience of DOOM 64 all monsters on the map will be randomized to a much more powerful version of a monster also some items and ammo are randomized so the player is not out of ammo, to avoid making the map unplayable

a new option has been added called Complex D64 to enable or disable game mode Complex DOOM 64
